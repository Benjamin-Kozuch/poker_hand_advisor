## How I Approached The Problem

First determined we are dealing with 3 different types of objects a Card, Hand and PokerHandAdvisor, so I made 3 classes for each of those.

A Card is one card with a value and a suit

A Hand is 5 cards.

A PokerHandAdvisor takes the original input and maintains a list of ever possible hand that can be generated by disposing of every different combination of cards and taking prospective new cards from the top of the deck.

After generating that list of all possible hands, sort the list and choose the best hand!

Creating that list of possible hands involved first taking out every combination of 1 card, and then every combination of 2 cards, then 3 and so on.

At each stage of disposing the cards, then create a new Hand by adding new cards from the top of the deck.

When each new hand is created, then determine the rank of that hand which is a method on the Hand class.

Determining the rank of each hand is a big If else if statement starting from best to worst. Each rank having a short but sweet algorithm to determine the rank.

In summary this was a really fun and cool problem which not only tested a wide gambit of topics but also allowed me to show off my skills. Thank you!

Looking forward to speaking with you again!
